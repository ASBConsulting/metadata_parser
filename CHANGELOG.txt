0.5.3
	- added a few `.strip()` calls to clean up metadata values

0.5.2
	- fixed an issue on html title parsing.  the old method incorrectly regexed on a BS4 tag, not tag contents, creating character encoding issues.

0.5.1
	- missed the ssl_verify command

0.5.0
	- migrated to the requests library

0.4.13
	- trapping all errors in httplib and urrlib2 ; raising as an NotParsable and sticking the original error into the `raised` attribute.
		this will allow for cleaner error handling
	- we *really* need to move to requests.py

0.4.12
	- created a workaround for sharethis hashbang urls, which urllib2 doesn't like
	- we need to move to requests.py

0.4.11
	- added more relaxed controls for parsing safe files

0.4.10
	- fixed force_parse arg on init
	- added support for more filetypes

0.4.9
	- support for gzip documents that pad with extra data ( spec allows, python module doesn't )
	- ensure proper document format

0.4.8
	- added support for twitter's own og style markup
	- cleaned up the beautifulsoup finds for og data
	- moved 'try' from encapsulating 'for' blocks to encapsulating the inner loop.  this will pull more data out if an error occurs.

0.4.7
	- cleaned up some code

0.4.6
	- realized that some servers return gzip content, despite not advertising that this client accepts that content ; fixed by using some ideas from mark pilgrim's feedparser.  metadata_parser now advertises gzip and zlib, and processes it as needed

0.4.5
	- fixed a bug that prevented toplevel directories from being parsed

0.4.4
	- made redirect/masked/shortened links have better dereferenced url support

0.4.2
	- Wrapped title tag traversal with an AttributeException try block
	- Wrapped canonical tag lookup with a KeyError try block, defaulting to 'href' then 'content'
	- Added support for `url_actual` and `url_info` , which persist the data from the urllib2.urlopen object's `geturl()` and `info()`
	- `get_discrete_url` and `absolute_url` use the underlying url_actual data
	- added support for passing data and headers into urllib2 requests

0.4.1
	Initial Release
